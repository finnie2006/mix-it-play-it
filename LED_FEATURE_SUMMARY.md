# LED Strip Control Feature - Summary

## Overview

A complete implementation for controlling LED strips via ESP32 when speaker mute is triggered in your radio mixer application. This provides a visual indicator that speakers are muted, helping prevent audio feedback during broadcasts.

## What's Been Created

### 1. ESP32 Arduino Sketch (`esp32-led-controller/esp32_led_strip.ino`)
- WiFi-enabled HTTP server for ESP32
- Controls WS2812B/NeoPixel LED strips
- Web interface for manual control
- REST API for automation
- Support for multiple animation modes (solid, pulse, blink, chase, rainbow)
- Configurable brightness and colors

### 2. LED Control Service (`src/services/ledControlService.ts`)
- TypeScript service for managing LED devices
- Stores configuration in localStorage
- Handles HTTP communication with ESP32 devices
- Supports multiple devices simultaneously
- Color and animation configuration
- Delayed turn-off feature

### 3. React Configuration Component (`src/components/LedControlConfig.tsx`)
- Full-featured UI for managing LED devices
- Add/remove/test devices
- Configure speaker mute indicator settings
- Real-time device status monitoring
- Color picker and animation selector
- Integration with existing settings system

### 4. Bridge Server Integration (`bridge-server/server.js`)
- Automatic LED control on speaker mute events
- HTTP communication with ESP32 devices
- Support for multiple LED devices
- Configurable delays and animations
- Error handling and logging

## How It Works

### The Flow

```
Mic Channel Opens (Above Threshold)
          ↓
Speaker Mute Activated
          ↓
Bridge Server Detects Change
          ↓
HTTP Request to ESP32
          ↓
LED Strip Turns RED
          ↓
(Visual Feedback: Mics Are Hot!)
          ↓
Mic Channel Closes (Below Threshold)
          ↓
Speaker Mute Deactivated
          ↓
Bridge Server Detects Change
          ↓
HTTP Request to ESP32
          ↓
LED Strip Turns OFF (with optional delay)
```

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Hardware Setup (15-30 minutes)
1. Wire ESP32 to LED strip (see wiring diagram in guide)
2. Connect 5V power supply to LED strip
3. Upload Arduino sketch to ESP32
4. Note the IP address from Serial Monitor

### 2. Software Setup (5 minutes)
1. Add LED device in Mix-It-Play-It settings
2. Enter ESP32 IP address
3. Test connection
4. Enable "Speaker Mute LED Indicator"
5. Link device to speaker mute events
6. Save configuration

### 3. Test (2 minutes)
1. Open a microphone channel above threshold
2. LED strip should turn red
3. Close microphone channel
4. LED strip should turn off

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| ESP32 won't connect to WiFi | Check credentials, use 2.4GHz network |
| LEDs don't light up | Verify power supply, check wiring |
| Can't find ESP32 IP | Check Serial Monitor, use network scanner |
| Test button fails | Verify IP address, check network |
| LEDs flicker | Add capacitor, improve power supply |
| Wrong colors | Adjust COLOR_ORDER in code |
