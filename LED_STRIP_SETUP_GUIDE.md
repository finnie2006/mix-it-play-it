## üîå Wiring Diagram

```
ESP32                    LED Strip
                         
GPIO 5 ----[470Œ©]----->  DATA IN
GND ------------------>  GND
                         
5V Power Supply
                         
+ (5V) --------------->  LED Strip VCC
- (GND) -------------->  LED Strip GND + ESP32 GND (common ground!)
```

### Important Wiring Notes

1. **Common Ground**: ESP32 GND and LED strip GND MUST be connected together
2. **Power the LED strip from external 5V**, not from ESP32 3.3V pin (insufficient current)
3. **For long strips** (>30 LEDs), inject power at both ends of the strip
4. **Data line resistor** (470Œ©) protects the first LED
5. **Capacitor** (1000ŒºF) across LED strip power prevents voltage spikes

### Pin Configuration

You can change the data pin in the Arduino sketch:
```cpp
#define LED_PIN     5    // Change this to any available GPIO pin
```

**Available GPIO pins on ESP32**: 2, 4, 5, 12-19, 21-23, 25-27, 32-33

‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid using**: GPIO 0, 1, 3, 6-11 (used for boot/flash)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### ESP32 Won't Connect to WiFi

**Problem**: ESP32 shows "WiFi connection failed" in Serial Monitor

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check WiFi credentials (case-sensitive!)
2. Make sure your WiFi is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
3. Check if MAC address filtering is enabled on your router
4. Try a different power supply (brown-out can cause issues)
5. Move closer to WiFi router

### LED Strip Doesn't Light Up

**Problem**: ESP32 works but LEDs don't respond

**Solutions**:
1. **Check power supply**: Is it 5V and sufficient amperage?
2. **Verify wiring**: 
   - Data line connected to correct GPIO pin?
   - Common ground connected?
3. **Test voltage**: Measure 5V at LED strip power pins
4. **Try different LED_PIN** in the code
5. **Check LED strip type**: Match COLOR_ORDER in code (GRB vs RGB)
6. **First LED might be dead**: Cut it off and reconnect to 2nd LED

### Can't Find ESP32 IP Address

**Problem**: Device not accessible on the network

**Solutions**:
1. Open Serial Monitor to see IP address on boot
2. Check your router's DHCP client list
3. Use a network scanner app (e.g., Fing, Advanced IP Scanner)
4. Assign a static IP in your router settings
5. Check if device is on the same network/VLAN

### Mix-It-Play-It Can't Connect to LED Device

**Problem**: Test button shows "Device Offline"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify IP address is correct
2. Check if ESP32 is powered and running
3. Test web interface directly in browser
4. Check firewall settings (allow port 80)
5. Make sure computer and ESP32 are on same network
6. Try pinging the device: `ping 192.168.1.100`

### LED Strip Flickers or Shows Wrong Colors

**Problem**: LEDs are unstable or incorrect colors

**Solutions**:
1. **Add capacitor** (1000ŒºF) across LED power supply
2. **Add resistor** (470Œ©) on data line
3. **Improve power supply**: Use thicker wires, shorter cables
4. **Check COLOR_ORDER**: Try changing GRB to RGB or BGR
5. **Reduce brightness**: Lower BRIGHTNESS value in code
6. **Inject power**: For long strips, add power at both ends

### LEDs Don't Turn Off

**Problem**: LEDs stay on even after speaker unmute

**Solutions**:
1. Check bridge server logs for errors
2. Verify LED device is checked in "Use for speaker mute indicator"
3. Test manually using "Test LED Indicator" button
4. Check network connectivity
5. Restart bridge server after configuration changes

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Multiple LED Devices

You can add multiple LED strips in different locations:
1. Set up multiple ESP32 boards with different IPs
2. Add each device in LED Control settings
3. Enable all devices for speaker mute indicator
4. All devices will respond simultaneously

### Custom Colors for Different Events

Edit `ledControlService.ts` to support different colors:
```typescript
// Example: Orange for warnings, red for mute
onColor: { r: 255, g: 165, b: 0 }  // Orange
```

### Animation Modes

Available animation modes:
- **Solid**: Static color (most common)
- **Pulse**: Smooth breathing effect
- **Blink**: On/off flashing
- **Chase**: Running light effect
- **Rainbow**: Cycling rainbow colors

### Static IP Configuration

To assign a static IP to your ESP32, add this to the sketch:
```cpp
IPAddress local_IP(192, 168, 1, 100);
IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1);
IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0);

void setup() {
  // Configure static IP
  if (!WiFi.config(local_IP, gateway, subnet)) {
    Serial.println("Static IP configuration failed");
  }
  
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  // ... rest of setup
}
```

### Power Calculation

Calculate your power supply requirements:
```
Max Current = (Number of LEDs) √ó 60mA
Example: 30 LEDs √ó 60mA = 1800mA = 1.8A

Recommended PSU = Max Current √ó 1.5 (safety margin)
Example: 1.8A √ó 1.5 = 2.7A ‚Üí Use 3A power supply
```

### Using Different LED Strip Types

For WS2811 (12V):
```cpp
#define LED_TYPE    WS2811
```

For APA102/DotStar (with clock line):
```cpp
#define LED_TYPE    APA102
#define COLOR_ORDER BGR
#define CLOCK_PIN   18  // Add clock pin
FastLED.addLeds<LED_TYPE, LED_PIN, CLOCK_PIN, COLOR_ORDER>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
```
